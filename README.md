# Buzz Simulation

**Game Description:** Buzz is a game where players start counting from one and take turns counting up by applying a rule that requires quick thinking and applying one's knowledge of their multiplication tables! The group begins by setting a rule pattern (i.e. the number the players will say buzz for). Once that is complete, players take turns counting and when the rule pattern is encountered or the number is divisible by that rule pattern, the player must say "Buzz".
