# Buzz Simulation and Play

**Game Description:** Buzz is a game where players start counting from one and take turns counting up by applying a rule that requires quick thinking and applying one's knowledge of their multiplication tables! The group begins by setting a rule pattern (i.e. the number the players will say buzz for). Once that is complete, players take turns counting and when the rule pattern is encountered or the number is divisible by that rule pattern, the player must say "Buzz".

In this game, players are given 2 options:

* **Game Simulation**: For this option, players will be given the prompt to enter their preferred rule pattern and the maximum number they want this simulation to go until. Once they click enter, the simulation will show them the game being played until the maximum number is reached. When this happens, the simulation will end and thus the program will end.

* **Game Play**: For this option, players play against each other by entering their number. The game ends when a player enters the wrong number. Note: the rule pattern for this game play is set to be 7. This means that numbers that contain a 7 or are divisible by 7 will be the numbers that players will have to say "buzz" for.

Enjoy the game!
